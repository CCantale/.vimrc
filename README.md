**relativenumber** shows the distance from the current line. It is useful to quickly jump from line to line using j/k + nbr.

**number** displays the actual number of the current line. It is useful to know where the float you are.

**syntax**, **ai** and **si** are generally set by default, but are often automatically desabled when you set a .vimrc file.

**nohlsearch** prevents Vim from highlighting the patterns you search to then keep the highlight untill the end of times.
**incsearch**, though, hilights the pattern while you type it. Nice.

**scrolloff** prevents the cursor from getting to the very top or bottom of the screen, so that you can always see what's
above or under it.

**belloff** allows you to live a calm and peaceful life without your ears being punished for the reason that you pressed
ESC twice. 

setting a **colorcolumn** is useful if you have a max number of columns per line philosophy or if you just need a hand to
notice when you are being a little bit too verbose.
